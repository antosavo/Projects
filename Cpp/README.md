-The code OpticalFiberModel.cpp simulates an optical communication fiber using the class of complex vectors called ComplexField.hpp.

-The output files are the intensity and the spectrum of the input wave at five different distances.

-The python scripts Plot_Intensity.py and Plot_Spectrum.py plot the output files.

-The code TestComplexField.cpp shows how the class ComplexField.hpp works.
